Most reminder apps post a silent notification. SpeakAlert plays the reminder out loud, so you
hear it even when the phone is in your pocket or across the room.

## Features

- **Reminders that talk.** Record your voice, type text for text-to-speech, or pick any audio
  file. Speech uses the reminder's own language (a Hindi reminder is spoken in Hindi).
- **Flexible repeats.** Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or custom intervals (every 30 minutes,
  every 3 days). Repeats can end never, on a date, or after a number of times.
- **Reminds until done.** An optional follow-up check re-alerts until you mark the reminder Done.
  Full-screen lock-screen alerts have Done, Silence and Snooze buttons.
- **Reliable delivery.** Exact alarms, rescheduling after reboot, a missed-reminder inbox,
  tone-only mode, optional Do Not Disturb bypass, and battery-optimisation guidance for
  restrictive phones.
- **Private playback.** Play reminders through the earpiece or Bluetooth headphones.
- **Widgets and Wear OS.** A quick-add widget, an upcoming-reminders widget, and alerts on
  Wear OS watches.
- **Backup and restore.** Exports every reminder, voice recordings included.
- **12 languages.** English, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Vietnamese,
  Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Greek and Malayalam, with right-to-left layout support.
- **Fully offline.** No account, no analytics, no network calls for reminders. Data stays on
  the device.

## Building

Requirements:

- Android Studio (Ladybug or newer) or the Android SDK command-line tools
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 36

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostgramlabs/SpeakAlert.git
cd SpeakAlert
./gradlew assembleDebug          # Windows: gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The debug APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Install it on a device or emulator
running Android 8.0 (API 26) or later:

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

Debug builds need no configuration. Only release builds need a signing key (see
[Release signing](#release-signing)).

### Running tests

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

Unit tests live in `app/src/test` and run on the JVM. Exact-alarm and notification behaviour
also needs testing on real devices; [docs/REMINDER_RELIABILITY_TEST_PLAN.md](docs/REMINDER_RELIABILITY_TEST_PLAN.md)
lists the manual checks.

### Release signing

Release builds read their signing key from `local.properties`, which git ignores:

```properties
speakalert.storeFile=your-release-key.jks
speakalert.storePassword=...
speakalert.keyAlias=...
speakalert.keyPassword=...
```

`storeFile` is resolved relative to the `app/` directory. Never commit a keystore or its
passwords.

## Project structure

The app is a single Gradle module written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, Room, DataStore,
AlarmManager, WorkManager and Media3, following an MVVM layout.
