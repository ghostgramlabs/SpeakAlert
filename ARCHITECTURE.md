# SpeakAlert architecture

This guide explains how SpeakAlert is put together, so you can find your way around before
changing it. For build steps see the [README](README.md); for how to submit changes see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Overview

SpeakAlert is a single-module Android app (`:app`) written in Kotlin.

| Concern | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| UI | Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Navigation Compose |
| State | MVVM: one `ViewModel` per screen, exposing Kotlin `Flow`s |
| Storage | Room (reminders, missed inbox), DataStore Preferences (settings) |
| Scheduling | `AlarmManager` exact alarms, WorkManager for boot rescheduling |
| Playback | Media3 ExoPlayer for recordings, Android `TextToSpeech` for text |
| Widgets | `AppWidgetProvider` with `RemoteViews` |

There is no network layer. Reminders, recordings and settings never leave the device, except
through a backup file the user exports themselves.

Dependencies are wired by hand, without a DI framework. `VoiceReminderApp` creates an
`AppContainerImpl` ([data/AppContainer.kt](app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/data/AppContainer.kt)),
which lazily builds the repositories and the `AlarmScheduler`. ViewModels get them through
`AppViewModelProvider`; receivers and services reach them via
`(context.applicationContext as VoiceReminderApp).container`.

## Packages

All paths are under `app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/`.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `alarm/` | Scheduling and firing reminders: `AlarmScheduler`, `ReminderAlarmReceiver`, follow-up alarms, notification actions, boot handling, notification channels, tone-only player |
| `audio/` | Recording (`AudioRecorder`), clean-up and enhancement of recordings (`VoiceProcessor`, `AudioEnhancer`), in-app preview playback |
| `data/` | Room database and DAOs, entities, repositories, `SettingsRepository` (DataStore), backup/restore |
| `domain/` | Recurrence model and maths (`RecurrenceUtils`): next occurrence, end rules, summaries |
| `service/` | `ReminderPlaybackService`, the foreground service that speaks a reminder, plus playback timeouts and TTS guards |
| `ui/` | Compose screens: `home`, `addedit`, `details`, `alert` (full-screen lock-screen alert), `settings`, shared `components`, `theme`, `navigation` |
| `widget/` | Quick Reminder and Upcoming Reminders home-screen widgets |
| `util/` | Helpers: dates and time formats, locale, battery-optimisation support, private audio routing, Wear OS detection, logging |

## Data model

The database (`AppDatabase`) has two tables.

**`reminders`** ([ReminderEntity](app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/data/model/ReminderEntity.kt)) holds one row per reminder:

- Content: `title`, `reminderText` (spoken by TTS), `audioPath` (a recording or a chosen audio file)
- Timing: `nextTriggerAt` is the next scheduled occurrence. `snoozeUntil`, when set, takes
  priority and is cleared when the snoozed alarm fires, so the recurrence resumes from
  `nextTriggerAt`.
- Recurrence: `recurrenceType` (`NONE`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`, `CUSTOM`) plus
  `recurrenceJson`, a serialised `RecurrenceModel` with the interval, weekdays, end rule and
  missed policy
- State: `isCompleted`, `completedAt`, `lastFiredAt`
- Follow-up check: `followUpCheckMinutes`, `pendingFollowUpAt`, `followUpFireCount`

**`missed_reminders`** ([MissedReminderEntity](app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/data/model/MissedReminderEntity.kt))
is the Missed inbox: one row each time an occurrence was not delivered on time.

Schema changes need a new `Migration` in `AppDatabase` and a version bump. The database falls
back to a destructive rebuild when no migration path exists, which would wipe users' reminders,
so always add the migration.

Settings (playback, quiet hours, snooze length, language, theme and so on) live in DataStore
and are read through `SettingsRepository`.

          advance recurrence (RecurrenceUtils) and schedule the next alarm
```

### 1. Scheduling

`AndroidAlarmScheduler` sets an exact `RTC_WAKEUP` alarm whose `PendingIntent` targets
`ReminderAlarmReceiver`, using the reminder ID as the request code. If the user has denied the
exact-alarm permission (Android 12+), it falls back to an inexact alarm. Follow-up checks use a
separate request-code range (`FollowUpAlarmScheduler`), so they never replace the main alarm.

### 2. Firing

[ReminderAlarmReceiver](app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/alarm/ReminderAlarmReceiver.kt)
holds most of the delivery rules. In order, it:

1. Loads the reminder and ignores duplicate fires for an occurrence that already fired.
2. Checks quiet hours and the user's temporary pause. A suppressed reminder goes to the Missed
   inbox, and its recurrence still advances.
3. Decides whether the alarm is late. The grace window is 60 seconds for minute or hour
   intervals and 5 minutes for calendar repeats; one-time reminders are always shown. A late
   recurring reminder follows its missed policy: `SKIP_TO_NEXT` logs it to the inbox silently,
   `FIRE_ON_RESUME` shows a "missed" notification.
4. On time: posts the notification (full-screen when the system allows it) and either starts
   `ReminderPlaybackService` for voice or TTS autoplay, or starts `ToneAlertPlayer` in tone-only
   mode.
5. Advances the recurrence with `RecurrenceUtils`, or ends it when its end rule is met, and
   schedules the next alarm. One-time reminders stay active until the user taps Done or
   Dismiss.
6. Schedules the next follow-up check if one is configured.

Notification buttons (Done, Snooze, Play, Stop) are handled by `ReminderActionReceiver`.

### 3. Playback

[ReminderPlaybackService](app/src/main/java/com/ghostgramlabs/speakalert/service/ReminderPlaybackService.kt)
is a `mediaPlayback` foreground service. It plays the recording with ExoPlayer or speaks the
text with TTS, optionally looping until a timeout, and requests transient audio focus. By default
it uses the alarm stream. With private playback on, it uses the media stream, or the earpiece
(voice-call stream) when the proximity sensor says the phone is at the user's ear.

All `TextToSpeech` calls run on a dedicated single thread. The engine can block for seconds,
and calling it on the main thread caused ANRs.

### 4. Reboot and clock changes

Alarms do not survive a reboot. `BootReceiver` handles `BOOT_COMPLETED`, `TIME_CHANGED` and
`TIMEZONE_CHANGED` by enqueuing `BootRescheduleWorker`. Android 15 forbids starting a
`mediaPlayback` foreground service from a boot broadcast, so the worker:

- reschedules future reminders normally, and
- handles reminders that came due while the phone was off inline: it adds them to the Missed
  inbox and schedules their next occurrence instead of firing them immediately.

On Android 15+, the receiver also skips autoplay for the first two minutes after boot.

## Backup format

`ReminderBackupManager` exports active reminders to a ZIP file containing `backup.json` (enums
stored by name so the format survives refactors) and an `audio/` entry per recording. On import,
past one-time reminders are skipped, past recurring ones are moved to their next occurrence, and
exact duplicates of existing reminders are skipped. Keep the format backwards compatible: older
backups must still import.

## Localisation

User-facing text belongs in `res/values/strings.xml`, with translations in `res/values-<code>/`
(currently ar, bn, el, es, hi, ml, pt-rBR, ru, ta, te, vi). Arabic is right-to-left; use
`RtlMirror` and start/end rather than left/right. The in-app language picker uses
`AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales`.

## Testing

Unit tests in `app/src/test` run on the JVM with JUnit 4, Mockito and coroutines-test, and
mirror the main package layout. Recurrence maths, missed-reminder rules, playback timeouts and
backup import are the most heavily tested areas; add tests there when you change them.

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

Alarm timing, notifications and audio routing depend on the device and Android version, and
JVM tests cannot cover them. Run the manual checks in
[docs/REMINDER_RELIABILITY_TEST_PLAN.md](docs/REMINDER_RELIABILITY_TEST_PLAN.md) before a release.

## Debugging

`FileLogger` traces the alarm path (scheduling, firing, missed decisions, playback) and can
write the trace to a log file in Downloads. Debug builds also expose extra options in Settings
(`BuildConfig.SHOW_DEBUG_OPTIONS`).
